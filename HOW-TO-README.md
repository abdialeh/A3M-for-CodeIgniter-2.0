Installation
============

1. Download the latest version of A3M (https://github.com/pengkong/A3M-for-CodeIgniter-2.0)
2. Extract to a folder (default is /a3m/ )
3. Create a database using the 'a3m_database.sql' script found it root folder of package
4. Modify /applicaion/config/config.php & database.php to match your setup (folder path + database credentials)
5. Modify your .htaccess file IF your detfault folder is different from /a3m/ (example: domain.com/a3m/)
6. Note that twitter doesn't work if your base url is 'localhost' and facebook doesn't work if your base url is '127.0.0.1'. Therefore ensure that your base url is something like 'yoursite.com'. One way to do that is to simply map the hostname your want to 127.0.0.1 on your development machine. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_%28file%29
7. Configure your external OpenID providers in /application/modules/account/config/*


    Your twitter callback URL should take into account whether or not you have enabled SSL in your a3m config https://a3m.mushmellow.com/a3m_mushmellow/account/connect_twitter (SSL Enabled) http://a3m.mushmellow.com/a3m_mushmellow/account/connect_twitter (SSL Disabled) Configuring this wrongly will result in an 'EpiOAuthUnauthorizedException' exception being thrown.

Note that A3M is a full package meant for building websites from scratch. If you are integrating A3M to you existing CI package you should only copy the "account" module. The required dependencies are the MY_Session and HVMC libraries and the /resource folder for css, images and javascripts.
